To use the Non-volatile RAM simulator, in RDBJAG type
	read nvmsim.rom 802000
	g 802000
The NVRAM BIOS will be copied to RAM, and then the
application will terminate with an illegal instruction
and return to the debugger.

Romulator memory from $900000 to $91ffff will be used
to hold the hiscore cartridge data. A sample disk image
(full of files containing random data) is provided as
"diskimg.img"; to load this, type "read diskimg.img 900000"
to the debugger.

If you hold down the "Option" key (and keep it held down)
before typing the "g 802000" instruction, you
will be presented with the "Save Cartridge Manager"
screen. This is a sample application which users will
also be able to access to delete files (PLEASE NOTE
THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE SAVE CARTRIDGE MANAGER
DOES NOT EXCUSE INDIVIDUAL APPLICATIONS FROM PROVIDING
SIMILAR FUNCTIONALITY THEMSELVES!!!). The save
cartridge manager uses the following keys:

up arrow/down arrow	selects files
A,B,C			to delete a file
OPTION			to choose how to sort files
OPTION+1		to save preferences in a file
OPTION+7+9		to create a (dummy) file
OPTION+*+#		to erase all files
OPTION+*+0+#		to do a test of free memory
*+#			to exit the manager

Once the Save Cartridge Manager has run, the BIOS will
be copied to RAM (at $2400). You can then reset
the machine and load and run your own application.
The BIOS will remain in RAM until the machine is
powered off.
