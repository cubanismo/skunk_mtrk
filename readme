The NVRAM boot rom automatically copies the NVRAM
BIOS into low memory when it starts up.

If you hold down the "Option" key (and keep it held down)
during the boot sequence, you will be presented with the
"Save Cartridge Manager" application. This application
allows users to delete files and to see how much
free space is available on the cartridge. The "Save
Cartridge Manager" application understands the
following keys:

Normal commands
---------------
up arrow/down arrow	selects files
A,B,C			to delete a file
OPTION			to choose how to sort files
OPTION+1		to save preferences in a file
OPTION+*+#		to erase all files
*+#			to exit the manager

Debugging commands
------------------
OPTION+*+0+#		to do a test of free memory
OPTION+7+9		to create a (dummy) file


If no CD-ROM is plugged in, the save cartridge will
always boot into the "Save Cartridge Manager", and
will never exit this application.



To run the diagnostic self-test at the factory:

(1) Plug the cartridge into a machine with no CD-ROM.
(2) Turn the machine on.
(3) Hold down the *, 0, and # keys (on controller 1)
    while keeping all of these down, press the Option
    key.
(4) Press the right arrow (to select "Yes" on the
    dialog box).
(5) Press the B button.

The screen will turn blue, and a dialog box will appear
that will indicate the progress of the test. 8 blocks
will be written, and then read back. If an error
occurs, the screen will turn red and a message will
be printed. If no error occurs, the screen will turn
green.
